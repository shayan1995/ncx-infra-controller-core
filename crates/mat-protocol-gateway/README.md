# mat-protocol-gateway

Single-endpoint UFM and RMS front for a multi-pod machine-a-tron deployment.

The gateway runs as a second container in the `mat-k8s-controller` pod. The Go
controller keeps all Kubernetes API access and publishes the machine-a-tron
instances it discovered on a pod-local HTTP endpoint. The gateway consumes that
list, points the `ufm-mock` reconciliation at every instance's
`/machines/status`, and serves the aggregated UFM REST API. It also serves the
RMS gRPC API (`RackManager` and `RackManagerV2`), learns from every instance's
`/racks/status` which racks it simulates, and forwards each RMS request to the
instance owning the rack it names; see [RMS routing](#rms-routing).

## Listener layout

There is exactly one service listener, `listen_address`. It serves the UFM
routes, both RMS gRPC services and both probes on the same port, over TLS when
`[tls]` is set and plain HTTP otherwise. There is no separate RMS or probe
port; Kubernetes probes and API clients hit the same socket.

The binary default is `0.0.0.0:9888` over plain HTTP, which is what you get
when the gateway is started without a configuration file. A deployment that
terminates TLS in the gateway sets `listen_address` and `[tls]` in the
configuration file.

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/livez` | Process is running; 200 from the moment the listener is up |
| `/readyz` | 503 until the source list is loaded, every source has answered `/racks/status` and reconciliation started; 503 again, one reason per line, while a source has never answered or two sources report one rack (see [rack ownership](#rack-ownership)) |
| `/ufmRestV3/...` | UFM API from `ufm-mock`, token protected (`UFM_MOCK_AUTH_TOKEN`) |
| injection management routes | Inherited from `ufm-mock` |
| `/rack_manager.RackManager/*`, `/rack_manager_v2.RackManagerV2/*` | RMS gRPC services, routed per rack; no per-request authentication, like the per-pod RMS mock |

`metrics_address` is the only other socket. It is optional, plain HTTP, and
exposes Prometheus metrics for the gateway and the embedded UFM mock.
`ufm.metrics_address` is rejected because the gateway owns that endpoint.

## Controller contract

`GET http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1/sources` returns:

```json
{
  "generation": 7,
  "ready": true,
  "sources": [
    {"name": "<service name>", "base_url": "https://<svc>.<ns>.svc.cluster.local:<port>", "pod": "<pod name or empty>"}
  ]
}
```

`generation` increments only when a source is added, removed, or changes URL;
a pod restart behind the same Service URL does not change it. `ready` is true
once the controller finished its first discovery. Sources are sorted by
`name`. The contract fixture is the controller's
`dev/k8s/machine-a-tron-controller/pkg/sourcelist/testdata/sources_v1.json`:
the Go handler test checks that its response is JSON-equal to it, and
`tests/integration/source_list_contract.rs` includes the same file and checks that the
gateway types carry exactly its fields, so a shape change fails on whichever
side was not updated.

The counter lives in controller memory. When the controller container
restarts it publishes `generation = 0, ready = false` until its first
discovery completes and then republishes the fleet as generation 1, so the
counter can move while the set is unchanged (any controller restart) and can
repeat a value for a different set (a source added or removed while the
controller was down; the fresh-pod case is generation 1 both times). The
gateway therefore treats the generation as a change hint for logs and decides
on the source set: the sorted `(name, base_url)` pairs, pod names excluded,
exactly the key the controller uses to bump the counter.

## Epoch model: bound to one source set

The gateway binds itself to the source set it started with and restarts when
that set changes. This keeps the reconciliation configuration immutable for
the life of a process, which is what `ufm-mock`'s static-source reconciliation
expects, at the cost of a container restart whenever the fleet layout changes.

1. Start the listener immediately. `/livez` returns 200; `/readyz` returns 503
   until step 3 completes.
2. Poll `controller.sources_url` until it reports `ready = true` and at least
   one source, up to `controller.startup_attempts` times with
   `controller.startup_retry_interval` between attempts (default 150 x 2s).
   Each failed attempt is logged so a slow controller can be told from a
   broken one. Exhausting the bound is a fatal error and the process exits
   non-zero.
3. Configure the UFM reconciliation with one static source per entry
   (`base_url` + `/machines/status`) and mark the gateway ready.
4. Every `controller.poll_interval`, re-fetch the source list and compare its
   `(name, base_url)` set with the startup set:
   - Same set, same generation: nothing to do.
   - `ready = false`: the controller container is restarting and has not
     rediscovered anything yet; the gateway keeps serving its set.
   - Same set, different generation: the controller restarted or republished;
     logged once per new value, no restart.
   - Different set (source added, removed, or URL changed): the process logs
     the startup and current generations with the added and removed names and
     exits with code 3 (`SOURCE_LIST_CHANGED_EXIT_CODE`). A source whose URL
     changed is listed under both added and removed. Kubernetes restarts only
     this container; the restarted gateway binds to the new set.

   A fetch failure during this phase is logged and retried on the next tick;
   an unreachable controller is not a reason to restart a working gateway.
   A list that is ready but empty counts as every source removed: the gateway
   exits and the restarted process waits in step 2 for a non-empty list.

Exit codes: 0 after SIGTERM or SIGINT, 3 on source set change, any other
non-zero value for a startup or listener failure.

A machine-a-tron pod restart behind an unchanged Service URL does not touch
the set. The instance comes back with a new `epoch_id` in `/machines/status`
and the `ufm-mock` reconciliation replaces that source's ports in place; the
gateway process keeps running.

### Restart back-off

Exit code 3 is the intended way to pick up a new fleet layout, not a crash,
but the kubelet does not distinguish the two. With `restartPolicy: Always`
every container exit after the first one within a 10-minute window is delayed
by an exponential back-off (10s, 20s, 40s, ... capped at 5 minutes) and the
pod reports `CrashLoopBackOff` while it waits; the back-off resets once the
container has run for 10 minutes. One fleet change therefore restarts the
gateway immediately, while several changes within ten minutes delay the
re-bind by up to five minutes each. The controller publishes a changed set
only once a later discovery pass, at least `--source-list-debounce` (default
5s) after the change was first seen, still reports it, so a Service that is
missing from one pass and back on the next never reaches the gateway, and
several changes between two passes arrive as one exit.

## Rack ownership

Every `ownership.poll_interval` the gateway fetches `/racks/status` from every
source of the startup list, concurrently and with the `[sources]` TLS
settings, and rebuilds one `rack_id -> source` table from the latest answer of
every source (`ownership.rs`). Routing never guesses:

- A rack reported by exactly one source is routed there.
- A rack reported by two sources is a conflict: it has no owner, requests for
  it are refused, and `/readyz` fails with `rack <id> is reported by <a>, <b>`
  until one source stops reporting it.
- A source whose polls fail keeps its last answer for `ownership.stale_after`
  and is then dropped: requests for its racks are `UNAVAILABLE` naming the
  source and are never redirected to another instance. The next successful
  poll restores it. `/readyz` stays 200; only the initial answer is required.
- A source that has not answered since the gateway started fails `/readyz`
  with `no rack status from source <name> yet: <error>` for `stale_after`
  after its first failed poll, then is dropped like any other so one dead
  instance cannot hold the fleet at not-ready. Its racks are unknown until it
  answers.
- A rack no source has ever reported is unknown.

`Gateway::bootstrap` takes the first snapshot of every source before it marks
the gateway ready, so `/readyz` never reports 200 without ownership having been
polled once, and the poll loop keeps the readiness flag in step afterwards. The
RMS proxy is created with the listener, before the source list exists, and
answers `UNAVAILABLE` until bootstrap binds the map.

## RMS routing

The gateway implements both RMS services with the `librms` server bindings
(`rms_proxy.rs`) and forwards to the instances of the bound source set over
HTTP/2 (`rms_client.rs`), reaching each instance at its `base_url`, the TLS
listener that also serves its simulated BMCs and status routes. It routes the
RPCs the per-pod RMS mock implements; everything else is `UNIMPLEMENTED` with a
message naming the RPC, as it would be on the instance.

| RPC | Routing |
|-----|---------|
| `GetVersion` | Answered by the gateway; no instance is contacted |
| `GetScaleUpFabricStatus`, `RackManagerV2.ConfigureScaleUpFabricManager` | Rack-scoped: forwarded unchanged to the owner of the rack the nodes name. Nodes naming two racks are `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, a rack whose owner was dropped is `UNAVAILABLE` naming the instance, a rack nobody reported is `NOT_FOUND` |
| `BatchGetNodeDeviceInfo`, `BatchGetScaleUpFabricServiceStatus`, `ConfigureSwitchCertificate` | Node batch: nodes are grouped by the owner of their `rack_id`, each group is sent to its instance concurrently, and the per-node results, stats and jobs are merged back in request order (by node id while the ids in a group are distinct, by position otherwise). A node whose rack nobody owns or whose owner was dropped is a per-node failure saying so and is never sent anywhere; an instance that fails the call fails only its own nodes |
| `GetJobStatus`, `GetConfigureSwitchCertificateJobStatus` | Resolved through the job table below; an empty id is `NOT_FOUND` |

Job ids: every job id in a response is a gateway id (`gw-<process token>-<n>`)
mapping to `(instance, instance job id)` in `rms_jobs.rs`. A batch whose nodes
live on one instance keeps that instance's parent job behind one gateway id. A
batch split across instances returns one aggregate parent id mapping to the
per-instance parents; its status is the worst, least advanced of theirs (failed
if any part failed, else queued before running before completed), it lists the
per-instance parents as its children, and `include_child_job_states` appends
their translated statuses. The table is in memory only, see below.

## In-memory state is lost on restart

`ufm-mock` keeps partitions (pkeys), port memberships, and QoS settings in
memory only. Every gateway restart, including the deliberate one on source set
change, starts from an empty partition table. Ports reappear as soon as the
first inventory poll completes, but anything created through the UFM write API
(`POST /ufmRestV3/resources/pkeys`, `PUT .../qos_conf`) is gone. This is
accepted for the simulation use case. Callers that create partitions must be
able to re-create them after `/readyz` returns 200 again, and scaling the
fleet during a run causes a window in which UFM partitions are absent.

The same applies to the RMS job table: an id neither issued nor polled for an
hour is forgotten, and a restart forgets every id at once. A status poll for an
id the gateway does not know is reported complete, as the per-pod RMS mock does
for ids it never issued, so a NICo operation that persisted the id finishes
instead of stranding; the per-instance jobs in the machine-a-tron pods are
unaffected.

Nothing is persisted or shared between gateway processes, so a fleet must be
served by exactly one gateway.

## Configuration

A TOML file passed as the only positional argument; the file is optional and
every key has a default. A path that is given but does not exist or cannot be
parsed is a startup error. Every key can be overridden with
`MAT_PROTOCOL_GATEWAY__<SECTION>__<KEY>` environment variables
(`MAT_PROTOCOL_GATEWAY__CONTROLLER__SOURCES_URL` sets
`controller.sources_url`). The UFM authentication token is read from
`UFM_MOCK_AUTH_TOKEN`, the same variable the standalone `ufm-mock` uses; it
is never part of the file.

Unknown keys in the gateway-owned tables (top level, `[tls]`, `[controller]`,
`[sources]`, `[ownership]`, `[rms]`) fail startup with an error naming the key. That includes a
misspelled `MAT_PROTOCOL_GATEWAY__` environment variable. Keys under `[ufm]`
are deserialized by the shared `ufm-mock` config type, which cannot deny
unknown fields because the standalone `ufm-mock` binary flattens it, so
unknown keys there are ignored.

## Tests

```bash
cargo test -p carbide-mat-protocol-gateway
```

`tests/integration/rms_routing.rs` runs two fake machine-a-tron instances that
declare their racks on `/racks/status` and serve the RMS mock, drives the
gateway through `run`, and calls it with an unmodified `librms` client: a
rack-scoped call reaches the rack's owner, a batch across both instances is
merged back in request order with an unowned node failed in place, the
aggregate certificate job polls to completion through gateway ids, a rack
reported twice blocks readiness and routing until one instance withdraws, an
instance that stops answering loses its racks after `stale_after` without them
moving elsewhere, and one down at startup holds readiness only that long.
