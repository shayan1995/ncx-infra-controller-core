//! Gateway job ids and what they stand for on the machine-a-tron instances.
//!
//! Every job id a caller receives from the gateway is minted here and maps to jobs on one or more
//! instances. Instance job ids are never handed out: two instances number their jobs
//! independently, so the same string can name two different jobs, and a caller must be able to
//! poll any id it was given without knowing which instance runs it.
//!
//! A batch the proxy split across instances gets one gateway parent id that maps to the
//! per-instance parents. Its state is the worst, least advanced of theirs: a failed part fails
//! the batch, otherwise a queued part keeps it queued and a running part keeps it running, and it
//! is complete only once every part is.
//!
//! The table lives in process memory. An id neither issued nor polled for [`JOB_RETENTION`] is
//! forgotten, and a gateway restart forgets every id at once; the proxy answers such ids the way
//! the RMS mock answers ids it never issued. Ids carry a per-process token so an id from a
//! previous process is never mistaken for one issued by the current one.
