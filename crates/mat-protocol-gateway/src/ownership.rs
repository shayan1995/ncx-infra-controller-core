//! Which controller source simulates which rack.
//!
//! Every machine-a-tron instance publishes the racks it simulates on `/racks/status`. The gateway
//! polls it on every source, folds the answers into one table and routes RMS requests by it: a
//! rack goes to the single source that reports it and nowhere else.
//!
//! - A rack reported by more than one source is a conflict. It has no owner and ownership is not
//!   ready until one of the sources stops reporting it.
//! - A source whose polls fail keeps its last answer for `ownership.stale_after` and is then
//!   dropped: requests for its racks are answered as unavailable, naming the source, and are never
//!   moved to another source.
//! - A source that has not answered since the gateway started blocks readiness for the same
//!   `stale_after`, measured from its first failed poll, and is then dropped like any other so one
//!   dead instance cannot hold the rest of the fleet at not-ready.
//! - A rack no source has ever reported is unknown.
